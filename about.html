		<p>This app's objective is to help you manage and track your goals during your life.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Are you thinking of losing weight or starting running?</li>
			<li>Do you want to stop smoking?</li>
			<li>Do you really know how much money do you spend paying your bills?</li>
			<li>Maybe you are trying to create metrics about some event of your life?</li>
			<li>Do you want to gather real useful information about your daily habits, so you can desing a better life?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you answered "yes" to any of these questions this app is for you.</p>
		<p>Lifestyle tracker will help you to measure your performance and gather some statistics about it!!!</p>
		<p>Start tracking is really easy. We will resume it in three simple steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Add a tracker. In order to do that tap on the "add tracker" button, provide a name and the kind of measure you are going to take (number and yes/no values (more in the future))</li>
			<li>Tap on the "add data" button, choose your tracker, add a value and a date. (you can add data inside a concrete track too).</li>
			<li>Tap on your tracker. Inside it, you will be able to find a graphic showing your progress, some statistics and all the entered data related with this tracker!</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Of course you will also find the typical options as remove/edit trackers and values.</p>
		<p>And that's all!</p>
